# Data Engineering Zoom Camp Notes
## Module 1: Terraform & Docker
### Summary
- Explored the generation of Docker containers using Dockerfiles and the Docker run command.
- Used Docker run command to start a postgresql database, then used Python / pandas in a Jupyter notebook to populate the database with the Green Taxi Data for the homework.
- Used pgAdmin to manage some SQL scripts and do some analysis on the Green Taxi Data based on Homework requirements.
- Used Terraform to establish some resources in GCP.
